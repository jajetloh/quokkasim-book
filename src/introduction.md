## What is QuokkaSim?

QuokkaSim is a high-performance, event-driven simulation framework written in Rust, on top of the [NeXosim](https://github.com/asynchronics/nexosim) simulation engine.

QuokkaSim is also:
- Open source
- Permissively licensed (MIT License)
- Memory-safe
- Highly performant, via the NeXosim crate
- Accessible to new simulation modellers and new Rust developers

## FAQ

**Why does QuokkaSim use Rust?**

- Building QuokkaSim in Rust means:
    - QuokkaSim can be free and open source under the MIT License.
    - QuokkaSim is highly performant (thanks to the [NeXosim](https://github.com/asynchronics/nexosim) library).
    - Simulations built in QuokkaSim can benefit from the type safety, memory safety, and explicit error handling that is fundamental to Rust. This strictness minimises issues that arise as a simulation model scales and increases in complexity.

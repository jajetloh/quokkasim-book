## FAQ

**Why does QuokkaSim use Rust?**

- Building QuokkaSim in Rust means:
    - QuokkaSim can be free and open source under the MIT License.
    - QuokkaSim is highly performant (thanks to the [NeXosim](https://github.com/asynchronics/nexosim) library).
    - Simulations built in QuokkaSim can benefit from the type safety, memory safety, and explicit error handling that is fundamental to Rust. This strictness minimises issues that arise as a simulation model scales and increases in complexity.
